# MySerial
Serial Debugger based on by pyserial.

## What is this python script?
This program is a part of my study of python.
It is developed through editing ` pyserial` example.


Using with python lancher is recommended.

## Usage
Usage is quite simple. Probably you wouldn't need this instruction but just in case.

### Step0. Call this script

~~~bash
$ python Myserial.py
~~~

### Step1. Specify serial port which you'd like to connect.

The prompt shows several options. Find your device and specify one of them by entering index number or its name. 

### Step2. Set Baudrate
After Step1,the prompt asks the baudrate which you'd like to use.
Enter the baudrate numbers. 
e,g `9600` `19200` `38400` `57600` `74880` `115200` `230400` ...
